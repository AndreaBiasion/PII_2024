# Event Detector from social media data


The rise in mobile phone and social media usage has profoundly changed how people experience and document climate and weather-related disasters. Social media platforms have proven to be invaluable tools for gathering real-time information during such events, enabling immediate updates and widespread sharing of crucial details. This report proposes a method to harness the potential of social media, specifically focusing on Telegram, as an alternative source for earthquake detection.  

Our approach involves leveraging the vast amount of data generated by users on Telegram during seismic events. By analyzing posts, messages, and updates from various Telegram group chats and channels, we aim to detect earthquakes more swiftly and accurately. This method offers a complementary resource to traditional earthquake monitoring systems, potentially filling in gaps where conventional data may be lacking or delayed.  

The primary goal of this project is to examine the relationship between information derived from social media and existing earthquake alert systems. We aim to assess how real-time data from Telegram compares with current earthquake detection methods in terms of timeliness and accuracy. By exploring this relationship, we hope to enhance the overall effectiveness of earthquake monitoring and response strategies.
